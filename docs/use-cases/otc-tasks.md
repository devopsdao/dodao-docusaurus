# Over-The-Counter (OTC) Tasks

![Strength in Partnership](../img/banners-new/Strength%20in%20Partnership.png)

**Private negotiations, institutional security, verified expertise.**

When Fortune 500 companies need confidential blockchain consulting, when DeFi protocols require private security audits before launch, when institutional investors seek discrete token swap advisory ‚Äì traditional freelance platforms fall short. They lack the privacy, security, and verification systems that high-stakes professional engagements demand.

OTC tasks transform sensitive business relationships by combining the privacy of traditional consulting with the security of smart contract escrow and the credibility of Skills NFT verification. Your most valuable work deserves the highest level of protection and professionalism.
