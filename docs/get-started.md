**Start in 5 minutes. Work across any blockchain.**

Your journey into the future of work begins now. In just five minutes, you'll go from curious observer to active participant in a revolutionary marketplace where talent meets opportunity without borders, intermediaries, or unfair fees.

Whether you're a developer tired of platform gatekeepers, a customer frustrated with unreliable freelancers, or simply someone who believes work should be fair and transparent, this is your moment to experience something completely different. No lengthy verification processes, no credit checks, no geographic restrictions ‚Äì just you, your skills, and a global marketplace powered by blockchain technology.

Ready to see what work looks like when it's truly decentralized? Let's get you started.

## Prerequisites

Don't worry if you're new to blockchain technology ‚Äì millions of people have made this transition successfully, and the tools have never been more user-friendly. Think of a Web3 wallet like a digital passport that proves who you are without revealing personal information.

### ü¶ä Web3 wallet
Your wallet is your identity in the decentralized world. Unlike traditional platforms that store your data on their servers, Web3 puts you in complete control. No one can freeze your account, change the rules on you, or lock you out of your earnings.

## Your first task

This is where the magic happens. Your first task on Dodao will feel different from any freelance experience you've had before. No lengthy approval processes, no wondering if you'll get paid, no arbitrary platform rules. Just clear requirements, guaranteed escrow, and automatic execution.

### üë§ As a customer

**Post your first task in 3 steps:**

The beauty of Dodao is that posting a task creates an unbreakable commitment. When you lock your payment in escrow, performers know you're serious. When they see smart contracts handling verification, they know they'll get paid for quality work.

1. **Click "Create Task"**
   - Fill in title and description with specific, measurable requirements
   - Set clear requirements that leave no room for misunderstanding
   - Choose deadline that gives performers adequate time for quality work

2. **Set payment**
   - Select token (ETH for simplicity, USDC for stability, or any token you prefer)
   - Enter amount that reflects the work's true value
   - Confirm transaction to lock funds in smart contract escrow

3. **Review proposals**
   - Wait for performer applications (usually within hours)
   - Review profiles, past work, and detailed proposals
   - Select best candidate based on skills and approach, not just price

### üõ†Ô∏è As a performer

**Find your first work:**

No more competing with hundreds of applicants for pennies. Dodao's cross-chain approach means more opportunities, while smart contract escrow means you'll actually get paid for your efforts.

1. **Browse tasks**
   - Filter by skills, payment range, and blockchain preference
   - Read requirements carefully to ensure you can deliver
   - Check customer ratings and past task history

2. **Submit proposal**
   - Explain your specific approach to solving their problem
   - Set realistic timeline that accounts for quality work
   - Include relevant experience and portfolio examples

3. **Complete work**
   - Communicate regularly with customer through built-in chat
   - Submit progress updates to build confidence
   - Deliver quality results that exceed expectations

## Common actions

These aren't just steps ‚Äì they're your pathway to experiencing work as it should be. Each action builds confidence in the system while moving you closer to successful collaboration.

### Creating a task

**Transform your vision into guaranteed results.** Every task you create becomes a smart contract that enforces fairness automatically. No more hoping freelancers will deliver ‚Äì the code ensures they will.

```
1. Connect wallet ‚Üí Choose network (Your identity across chains)
2. Click "Create Task" ‚Üí Fill details (Clear requirements prevent disputes)
3. Set payment ‚Üí Select token and amount (Fair compensation attracts quality)
4. Submit ‚Üí Confirm transaction (Funds locked safely until completion)
5. Wait ‚Üí Review incoming proposals (Quality talent finds quality projects)
```

*Each step builds trust between you and performers before work even begins.*

### Applying for work

**Turn your skills into guaranteed income.** When you apply for work on Dodao, you're not just hoping to get picked ‚Äì you're showcasing your value to clients who are committed to paying for quality.

```
1. Browse tasks ‚Üí Filter by preferences (Find work that matches your expertise)
2. Read requirements ‚Üí Check if you qualify (Understand exactly what's needed)

```
1. Escrow ‚Üí Funds locked automatically (Customer's commitment is guaranteed)
2. Milestones ‚Üí Track progress together (Build confidence through transparency)
3. Completion ‚Üí Submit final work (Deliver quality knowing payment awaits)

5. Payment ‚Üí Released automatically (Instant settlement, no delays)
```

*From escrow to payment, every step protects both parties equally.*

## Network guide

**Your passport to the multi-chain future.** Each blockchain offers unique advantages, and Dodao lets you experience them all. Think of networks as different countries ‚Äì each with its own currency and culture, but all part of the same global economy.

### Switching networks

**Exploring different blockchain ecosystems is like traveling the world ‚Äì each offers unique experiences and opportunities.** Your wallet is your passport, and switching networks is as simple as choosing your destination.

**In MetaMask:**
1. Click network dropdown (Your gateway to different blockchains)
2. Select "Add Network" (Discover new ecosystems)
3. Enter network details (Connect to your chosen blockchain)
4. Switch to new network (Start exploring new opportunities)

**Network details for your journey:**
- **Moonbase Alpha**: Chain ID 1287 (Fast, efficient, Substrate-powered)
- **Polygon Mumbai**: Chain ID 80001 (Ethereum-compatible scaling)
- **Scroll Sepolia**: Chain ID 534351 (Zero-knowledge innovation)

*Each network opens doors to different opportunities and experiences.*

### Getting tokens

**Fuel for your blockchain journey.** Test tokens are like getting local currency when you visit a new country ‚Äì they let you experience everything the ecosystem has to offer without any real-world cost.

**Faucet requirements (your ticket to free exploration):**
- Connected wallet (Your blockchain identity)
- Valid testnet address (Proof you're ready to explore)
- Usually 24-hour cooldown (Prevents abuse, ensures fair access)
- Free test tokens only (Risk-free experimentation)

**Token amounts (enough to get started):**
- Usually 1-10 tokens per request (Sufficient for multiple transactions)
- Enough for multiple transactions (Test everything without worry)
- Request more if needed (Faucets are generous with test tokens)

*Think of test tokens as your playground currency ‚Äì experiment freely!*

## Troubleshooting

Don't worry if you hit a snag ‚Äì blockchain technology can be finicky, especially on testnets. Most issues have simple solutions, and our community is always ready to help newcomers get up and running.

### Common issues

**Wallet won't connect**
This is usually a browser or wallet state issue, not a problem with Dodao itself. Web3 connections can be sensitive to browser state and wallet status.

- Refresh page and try again ‚Äì often solves temporary connection issues
- Check if wallet is unlocked ‚Äì MetaMask needs to be unlocked to connect
- Clear browser cache ‚Äì old data can interfere with new connections
- Try different browser ‚Äì some browsers handle Web3 better than others

**Transaction fails**
Blockchain transactions can fail for various reasons, but it's usually related to gas fees or network congestion. Don't worry ‚Äì failed transactions don't cost you tokens on testnet.

- Check you have enough tokens ‚Äì you need tokens for both payment and gas fees
- Increase gas limit if needed ‚Äì complex transactions need more gas
- Wait and try again ‚Äì network congestion can cause temporary failures
- Switch to different network ‚Äì try a less congested blockchain

**Can't see tasks**
Task visibility depends on being connected to the right network. Each blockchain has its own set of tasks, so make sure you're looking in the right place.

- Ensure you're on correct network ‚Äì tasks are network-specific
- Refresh the page ‚Äì sometimes data needs a moment to load
- Check network connection ‚Äì poor internet can affect data loading
- Try different browser ‚Äì some browsers cache data differently
