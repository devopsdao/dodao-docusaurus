# Developer Overview

![Strength in Partnership](../img/banners-new/Strength%20in%20Partnership.png)

**Build on Dodao.**

Remember when building decentralized applications meant choosing between different blockchains, wrestling with incompatible protocols, and spending months on infrastructure instead of innovation? Those days are over.

Dodao provides the foundation you've been waiting for: a battle-tested, cross-chain marketplace with Diamond pattern upgradability, four integrated bridge protocols, and APIs that actually make sense. We've solved the hard problems so you can focus on what matters ‚Äì building amazing experiences for users.

Whether you're creating the next breakthrough DeFi protocol, launching an innovative NFT marketplace, or building tools that don't exist yet, Dodao gives you the infrastructure to make it happen. No more reinventing the wheel. No more choosing between networks. Just pure creative freedom backed by enterprise-grade technology.

This is your platform to build the future of work.

## Why build on Dodao?

Most blockchain platforms force you to choose between innovation and infrastructure. You either spend months building basic functionality from scratch, or you accept the limitations of existing solutions. Dodao eliminates this false choice by providing enterprise-grade infrastructure that grows with your vision.

### üíé Diamond pattern architecture
Forget the days of deploying new contracts every time you need to add features. Our Diamond pattern implementation lets you upgrade functionality without breaking existing integrations or losing state. Build once, evolve forever.

### üåê Cross-chain by design
Why limit your application to one blockchain when users exist everywhere? Our native multi-protocol support means your app works on Ethereum, Polygon, Moonbeam, and beyond ‚Äì without you having to become an expert in bridge protocols.

### üîí Battle-tested security
Security isn't an afterthought here. Multi-signature governance, economic incentives, and comprehensive protection mechanisms are built into the foundation. Focus on your application logic while we handle the security infrastructure.

### üìö Complete documentation
No more guessing how things work or reverse-engineering from incomplete examples. Every function, every parameter, every integration pattern is documented with working code examples and real-world use cases.

## Platform architecture

**Engineering excellence that empowers your innovation.** We've spent months solving the hard problems so you can focus on what matters ‚Äì building amazing experiences that change how people work.

const dodao = new ethers.Contract(DODAO_ADDRESS, DodaoABI, provider);

// Create task
const tx = await dodao.createTask(
  "Build React component",
  "Responsive dashboard component with TypeScript",
  ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"),
  ETH_ADDRESS,
  Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400 * 7 // 1 week
);
```

**Cross-chain operations:**
```javascript
// Cross-chain task creation
import { AxelarGateway } from '@axelar-network/axelar-sdk';

const gateway = new AxelarGateway(provider);
await gateway.callContract(
  'polygon',
  DODAO_POLYGON_ADDRESS,
  payload
);
```

});

const tasks = await dodao.getTasks({
  category: 'development',
  minPayment: '0.1'
});
```

## Development workflows

**From idea to production in minutes, not months.** Our streamlined workflows eliminate the complexity that usually slows down blockchain development, letting you focus on building features that matter.

### üöÄ Quick start

**Go from zero to working integration faster than you thought possible.** We've eliminated the usual blockchain development friction with templates, examples, and tools that just work.

**1. Environment setup (one command to rule them all):**
```bash
# Clone starter template
git clone https://github.com/devopsdao/dodao-integration-template
cd dodao-integration-template

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your RPC URLs and contract addresses
```

**2. Basic integration (powerful functionality in just a few lines):**
```javascript
// Initialize Dodao SDK
import { Dodao } from '@dodao/sdk';

const dodao = new Dodao({
  network: 'moonbase-alpha',
  provider: window.ethereum
});

// Get available tasks
const tasks = await dodao.tasks.getAll();

// Create new task
const task = await dodao.tasks.create({
  title: "Smart contract audit",
  description: "Security review of DeFi protocol",
  payment: "5.0",
  token: "ETH",
  deadline: "2024-01-15"
});
```

**3. Advanced features (enterprise capabilities with simple APIs):**
```javascript
// Cross-chain task creation
const crossChainTask = await dodao.tasks.createCrossChain({
  sourceChain: 'polygon',
  targetChain: 'moonbeam',
  task: taskData
});

// Monitor task status
dodao.tasks.on('statusUpdate', (taskId, status) => {
  console.log(`Task ${taskId} status: ${status}`);
});
```

*Complex blockchain operations become as simple as calling a function.*

### üîß Testing and deployment

**Local development:**
```bash
# Start local blockchain
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network localhost

  );
  return await _client.sendTransaction(_credentials!, transaction, chainId: _chainId);
}
```

## Advanced integration

### ü§ñ Automated workflows

**GitHub integration:**
```javascript
// Automatic task creation from GitHub issues
const githubWebhook = async (req, res) => {
  const { action, issue } = req.body;
  
  if (action === 'opened' && issue.labels.includes('bounty')) {
    await dodao.tasks.create({
      title: issue.title,
      description: issue.body,
      githubUrl: issue.html_url,
      payment: extractBountyAmount(issue.body),
      verification: {
        type: 'github',
        repository: issue.repository.full_name,
        issueNumber: issue.number
      }
    });
  }
};
```

**Oracle verification:**
```javascript
// Custom verification logic
const customVerification = {
  type: 'custom',
  verifier: async (taskId, submission) => {
    // Custom verification logic
    const isValid = await verifySubmission(submission);
    return {
      valid: isValid,
      score: calculateQualityScore(submission),
      feedback: generateFeedback(submission)
    };
  }
};

await dodao.tasks.create({
  ...taskData,
  verification: customVerification
});
```

### üîó Cross-chain automation

**Multi-chain task distribution:**
```javascript
// Distribute task across multiple chains
const multiChainTask = await dodao.tasks.createMultiChain({
  chains: ['moonbeam', 'polygon', 'scroll'],
  task: taskData,
  distribution: 'round-robin' // or 'cost-optimized'
});
```

**Automated arbitrage:**
```javascript
// Monitor cross-chain opportunities
dodao.on('crossChainOpportunity', async (opportunity) => {
  if (opportunity.profit > threshold) {
    await dodao.arbitrage.execute(opportunity);
  }
});
```

## Security considerations

**Protection that scales with your success.** Security isn't just about preventing attacks ‚Äì it's about building user trust and ensuring your application can handle real-world usage without compromising safety.

### üîí Best practices

**Security as a foundation, not an afterthought.** These practices aren't just recommendations ‚Äì they're the difference between applications that thrive and those that become cautionary tales.

**Smart contract security (protecting user funds and data):**
- Always use latest SDK versions (security improvements and bug fixes)
- Validate all user inputs (prevent injection and manipulation attacks)
- Implement proper access controls (ensure only authorized actions are possible)
- Use multi-signature for critical operations (distribute risk and prevent single points of failure)

**Cross-chain security (maintaining trust across networks):**
- Verify message authenticity (ensure cross-chain messages haven't been tampered with)
- Implement timeout mechanisms (prevent stuck transactions and resource locks)
- Use multiple protocol validation (redundancy that catches edge cases)
- Monitor for unusual activity (early detection of potential security issues)

**API security (protecting your application and users):**
- Implement rate limiting (prevent abuse and ensure fair access)
- Use secure authentication (protect user accounts and sensitive operations)
- Validate all parameters (prevent injection attacks and data corruption)
- Log security events (maintain audit trails for compliance and debugging)

*Security is an investment in your application's future and your users' trust.*

### üõ°Ô∏è Common pitfalls

**Learn from others' mistakes before they become your own.** These aren't just technical issues ‚Äì they're the difference between professional applications and amateur projects.

**Avoid these mistakes that compromise security and user experience:**
- Hardcoding contract addresses (breaks when contracts upgrade or networks change)
- Ignoring network-specific configurations (causes failures in production environments)
- Insufficient error handling (creates poor user experiences and potential security holes)
- Missing event listeners for state changes (leads to inconsistent UI and missed opportunities)

*Professional development means anticipating problems before they happen.*
