## üéØ Skills NFTs System Details

### Core Mechanics (Based on Requirements)
- **Minting**: Customers pay fee and attach skills NFTs to tasks as rewards
- **Earning**: Performers receive skills NFTs upon successful task completion
- **Reputation**: Multiple NFTs of same skill = more experience/expertise
- **Permanence**: Skills NFTs last forever (no expiration)
- **Future Trading**: Users will be able to sell skills NFTs to other users

### Skill Categories to Document
- **Technical Skills**: Solidity, React, Python, Rust, Security Auditing, Cross-chain Development
- **Design Skills**: UI/UX Design, Graphic Design, 3D Modeling, NFT Artwork, Brand Identity
- **Business Skills**: Strategy, Marketing, Community Management, Content Creation
- **Specialized Skills**: DeFi Protocol Development, DAO Governance, Blockchain Consulting

### Organization/Project NFTs
- **Purpose**: Create closed sections visible only to NFT holders
- **Use Cases**: Project-specific tasks, DAO member exclusive work, organization sprints
- **Integration**: Milestone and sprint-based development workflows

## üìù Content Approach

### Narrative Style
- **Compelling Scenarios**: Fictional but realistic examples
- **User Empathy**: Address real pain points and solutions
- **Technical Accuracy**: Based on actual smart contract implementation
- **Global Perspective**: Inclusive examples from different regions
- **Action-Oriented**: Clear next steps and practical guidance

### User Journey Examples to Create
- **OTC Scenario**: Private DeFi consultation with skills verification
