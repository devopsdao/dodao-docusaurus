# Privacy Policy

![Privacy Matters](../img/banners-new/Privacy%20Matters.png)

**Your privacy matters.**

In a world where tech giants profit from your personal data while keeping you in the dark about how it's used, Dodao takes a fundamentally different approach. We believe privacy isn't a luxury ‚Äì it's a fundamental right that should be built into the foundation of every platform.

Unlike traditional companies that collect everything they can and ask for forgiveness later, we practice radical data minimization. We only collect what's absolutely necessary for the platform to function, we encrypt everything we can, and we give you complete control over your information. Most importantly, we're transparent about every aspect of our data practices because you deserve to know exactly how your information is handled.

This isn't just a legal document ‚Äì it's our commitment to treating your privacy with the respect it deserves.

*Last updated: December 24, 2024*

## Overview

### üîí Privacy principles

**The foundation of trust in a trustless world.** While blockchain technology eliminates the need to trust intermediaries with your money, you still need to trust platforms with your personal information. These principles ensure that trust is well-placed.

**Data minimization (less is more, always):**
- Collect only necessary information (if we don't need it, we don't ask for it)
- Store data for limited time periods (temporary storage for temporary needs)
- Delete data when no longer needed (automatic cleanup, not endless hoarding)
- Provide user control over data (your information, your decisions)

**Transparency (no secrets, no surprises):**
- Clear data collection practices (you know exactly what we collect and why)
- Open source smart contracts (code is public, auditable, and verifiable)
- Public blockchain transactions (financial transparency through mathematical proof)
- Transparent governance processes (community decisions in the open)

**User control (your data, your rules):**
- Own your data and identity (not rented from us, owned by you)
- Control information sharing (decide what to share and with whom)
- Delete account and data (leave whenever you want, take everything with you)
- Export personal information (your data in standard formats, ready to move)

**Security first (protection by design, not afterthought):**
- End-to-end encryption (your communications stay between you and intended recipients)
- Secure data storage (military-grade protection for your information)
- Regular security audits (continuous testing by independent experts)
- Best practice implementation (following industry standards and exceeding them)

*Privacy isn't a feature we added ‚Äì it's the foundation we built everything on.*

## Information we collect

### üìä Blockchain data

**The price of transparency is public visibility.** Blockchain technology gives us unprecedented transparency and security, but it comes with a trade-off: certain information must be public to make the system work. Here's exactly what's visible and why.

**Public blockchain information (visible to everyone, forever):**
- Wallet addresses and transactions (your financial activity on the platform)
- Smart contract interactions (every action you take through our contracts)
- Task creation and completion (the work you post or complete)
- Payment and escrow activities (money flowing through the system)
- Governance participation (your votes and proposals)

**This data is (the nature of blockchain transparency):**
- Publicly visible on blockchain (anyone can see it, including competitors and governments)
- Immutable and permanent (cannot be changed or deleted, ever)
- Required for platform operation (without this transparency, the system cannot function)
- Not personally identifiable alone (wallet addresses don't reveal your real identity unless you connect them)

*This is the trade-off of decentralization: public financial activity in exchange for freedom from corporate control.*

### üë§ Profile information

**Your professional identity, your choice.** Unlike traditional platforms that demand extensive personal information upfront, we let you decide exactly what to share and when. Build the professional presence you want, not what we require.

**Voluntary profile data (share what helps you succeed):**
- Display name and bio (how you want to be known professionally)
- Skills and experience (showcase your expertise and background)
- Portfolio links (let your work speak for itself)
- Profile pictures (put a face to your professional identity)
- Location (optional) (share your timezone or region if it helps with work)

**You control (complete autonomy over your professional presence):**
- What information to share (from minimal to comprehensive, your choice)
- Profile visibility settings (public, private, or somewhere in between)
- Information updates and changes (evolve your profile as you grow)
- Profile deletion (remove everything if you decide to leave)

*Your professional identity belongs to you ‚Äì we just provide the platform to showcase it.*
