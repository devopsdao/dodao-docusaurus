![Try as Performer](../../img/try-as-performer-iphone.png)

**Your journey from application to expertise.**

*"The best time to start building your decentralized career was yesterday. The second best time is right now."*

Welcome to the future of work ‚Äì where your skills matter more than your location, where your reputation belongs to you, and where every task completed builds toward true professional sovereignty. This isn't just another freelance platform; it's your gateway to a career that transcends borders, platforms, and traditional employment limitations.

Whether you're a seasoned developer tired of platform dependency or a newcomer ready to embrace the decentralized economy, this guide will transform you from curious observer to confident performer in the Dodao ecosystem.

Your decentralized career starts here.

## Before you begin: The mindset shift

### üß† From employee to entrepreneur

**Traditional work mindset:**
- Wait for opportunities to be assigned

- Accept whatever terms are offered

**Dodao performer mindset:**
- Actively seek and create opportunities
- Compete based on value and expertise
- Own your reputation and professional identity
- Participate in platform governance and direction

**The sovereignty principle:**
In the decentralized work economy, you're not just a service provider ‚Äì you're a stakeholder in the ecosystem itself. Your success contributes to platform growth, and platform growth amplifies your opportunities.

### üåç Global opportunities, local impact

**Think globally:**
- Your next customer could be anywhere in the world
- Payment can happen in any supported cryptocurrency
- Work across multiple blockchain ecosystems
- Build reputation that transcends geographic boundaries

**Act locally:**
- Leverage your unique cultural and linguistic advantages
- Build relationships within your time zone and region
- Contribute to local blockchain communities
- Mentor newcomers from your area

*"In the decentralized economy, your passport doesn't determine your opportunities ‚Äì your skills do."*
