# Gitcoin User Story

![Building the Future Together](../img/banners-new/Building%20the%20Future%20Together.png)

**From Gitcoin to Dodao: A developer's journey to true ownership.**

*"I thought I understood decentralized work until I discovered what it really means to own your professional identity."*

Meet Sarah Chen, a full-stack developer from Singapore who spent three years building her reputation on Gitcoin before discovering Dodao. Her story illustrates the evolution from platform-dependent work to true professional sovereignty ‚Äì and why the future of decentralized work is about more than just getting paid in crypto.

This isn't just a user story. It's a glimpse into the future where developers don't just work on decentralized platforms ‚Äì they own them.

## The Gitcoin years: Building on borrowed ground

### üéØ The promise that drew her in

**2021: The discovery**
Sarah discovered Gitcoin during the DeFi summer, drawn by the promise of getting paid in crypto for meaningful open-source work. Coming from traditional freelance platforms where payment disputes were common and fees were high, the idea of transparent, blockchain-based payments felt revolutionary.

*"Finally, a platform that understood that developers wanted to be paid in the future of money, not yesterday's banking system."*

**Early success and growing influence**
- Completed 47 bounties across DeFi protocols
- Earned 12.5 ETH in her first year
- Built relationships with major protocol teams
- Developed expertise in smart contract security

**The platform dependency trap**
But as Sarah's reputation grew, so did her dependence on Gitcoin's algorithms, policies, and platform decisions. Her professional identity was tied to a platform she didn't control.

### üìà Success within limitations

**What worked well:**
- **Crypto payments**: No more waiting for bank transfers or dealing with payment processors
- **Open source focus**: Working on projects that mattered to the ecosystem
- **Community connections**: Building relationships with other developers and protocol teams
- **Skill development**: Constant exposure to cutting-edge blockchain technology

**Growing frustrations:**
- **Platform fees**: 5-10% fees on every bounty, eating into earnings
- **Limited control**: No say in platform direction or policy changes
- **Reputation lock-in**: Years of work tied to a single platform
- **Competition intensity**: Hundreds of developers competing for the same bounties
- **Algorithmic uncertainty**: Never knowing why some applications were prioritized over others

*"I was successful on Gitcoin, but I wasn't in control. My reputation, my network, my professional identity ‚Äì it all belonged to someone else's platform."*

## The transition: Discovering true ownership

### üîç First encounter with Dodao

**The moment of realization**
Sarah first heard about Dodao in a Discord conversation about cross-chain development. A fellow developer mentioned completing a task that paid out on Polygon while the customer was on Moonbeam ‚Äì something impossible on traditional platforms.

*"Wait, you can work across different blockchains seamlessly? And the platform doesn't control your reputation?"*

**Initial skepticism**
Coming from years of platform disappointments, Sarah was cautious. Another "revolutionary" platform? She'd heard those promises before. But the technical architecture caught her attention ‚Äì the Diamond pattern, cross-chain capabilities, and most importantly, the governance structure.

**The first task**
Sarah's first Dodao task was a smart contract audit for a cross-chain DeFi protocol. The experience was immediately different:

- **Transparent selection**: She could see exactly why she was chosen over other applicants
- **Direct communication**: Built-in messaging system with the customer
- **Fair dispute resolution**: Clear audit process if anything went wrong
- **Cross-chain payment**: Received USDC on Polygon while working on an Ethereum project
- **Reputation ownership**: Her work history was stored on-chain, not in a company database

### üí° The ownership revelation

**Beyond just payments**
What struck Sarah wasn't just the technical capabilities ‚Äì it was the fundamental shift in power dynamics. On Gitcoin, she was a user of someone else's platform. On Dodao, she was a stakeholder in a community-owned ecosystem.

**Governance participation**
Within her first month, Sarah was voting on platform improvements, suggesting new features, and participating in discussions about the future of decentralized work. Her voice mattered not because the platform allowed it, but because the architecture guaranteed it.

**Professional sovereignty**
For the first time, Sarah's professional identity belonged to her. Her reputation, work history, and network connections were stored on-chain, portable across any application that chose to integrate with Dodao's infrastructure.

*"This wasn't just a better freelance platform ‚Äì it was a completely different paradigm. I went from being a user to being an owner."*

## The transformation: From user to stakeholder

### üöÄ Expanding opportunities

**Cross-chain specialization**
Sarah leveraged Dodao's cross-chain capabilities to become a specialist in multi-chain integrations. This niche expertise, combined with her Gitcoin experience, made her one of the most sought-after developers on the platform.

**Notable achievements:**
- **Cross-chain bridge audit**: Led security review for a $50M bridge protocol
- **Multi-chain governance**: Designed governance system working across 5 different chains
- **Protocol integration**: Helped major DeFi protocol expand to 3 new networks
- **Community leadership**: Elected to Dodao's community council

**Financial transformation**
- **Higher rates**: Specialized expertise commanded premium pricing
- **Lower fees**: Platform fees of 2.5% vs Gitcoin's 5-10%
- **Token rewards**: Earned governance tokens for platform participation
- **Cross-chain efficiency**: Optimized payment routes saved 15-20% on transaction costs

### üèõÔ∏è Governance participation

**From user to owner**
Sarah's transition from platform user to platform owner happened gradually through governance participation:

**Month 1-3: Observer**
- Voted on basic proposals
- Learned governance processes
- Built relationships with other stakeholders

**Month 4-6: Contributor**
- Created first technical proposal (cross-chain fee optimization)
- Joined working groups on platform development
- Mentored new developers joining the platform

**Month 7-12: Leader**
- Elected to community council
- Led major protocol upgrade initiative
- Represented developer interests in partnership discussions

*"I went from hoping the platform would make good decisions to actually making those decisions myself."*

### üåê Network effects

**Professional network expansion**
Dodao's cross-chain nature exposed Sarah to opportunities across multiple ecosystems:

- **Ethereum projects**: Leveraging her DeFi expertise from Gitcoin days
- **Polkadot ecosystem**: New opportunities in substrate-based chains
- **Cosmos network**: IBC protocol integration projects
- **Layer 2 solutions**: Scaling solution implementations

**Reputation portability**
Unlike Gitcoin where her reputation was platform-locked, Sarah's Dodao reputation was portable:
- **Portfolio integration**: Her work history integrated with her personal website
- **Cross-platform recognition**: Other platforms could verify her Dodao achievements
- **Decentralized identity**: Professional identity not dependent on any single platform

## Lessons learned: The future of decentralized work

### üîÆ Vision for the future

**Beyond platforms to ecosystems**
Sarah's journey illustrates the evolution from platform-based work to ecosystem participation. The future isn't about finding better freelance platforms ‚Äì it's about owning and governing the infrastructure of work itself.

**Key insights:**
1. **Ownership matters**: Professional identity should belong to professionals, not platforms
2. **Governance participation**: Having a voice in platform direction creates better outcomes
3. **Cross-chain is essential**: The future is multi-chain, and platforms must adapt
4. **Community over competition**: Collaborative ecosystems outperform competitive platforms
5. **Sovereignty enables innovation**: When developers own their tools, they build better solutions

### üìà Recommendations for other developers
