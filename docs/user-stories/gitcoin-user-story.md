# Multiplying Gitcoin Grants with Dodao

In this user story, we'll explore how a project can leverage the Dodao platform to maximize the impact of their Gitcoin Grant and involve the broader community in their development process.

## The Challenge

A project has received a $55,000 grant on Gitcoin to build a new decentralized application. They want to make the most of this funding and involve the community in the development process, but they face a few challenges:

- Ensuring transparency and accountability in how the grant funds are used
- Attracting top talent to work on the project
- Engaging the broader community and allowing them to contribute to the project's success

## The Solution

By using the Dodao platform, the project can overcome these challenges and multiply the impact of their Gitcoin Grant:

1. **Task Creation and Fund Allocation**: The project splits their work into specific tasks on Dodao.dev and funds each of them with a portion of the grant.

2. **Developer Selection**: For most tasks, they select their own trusted developers based on their project NFT tag and wallet ID, ensuring quality and reliability.

3. **Community Involvement**: For tasks where they don't have developers with the required skills, they open them to the Dodao community, allowing qualified Performers to apply and contribute.

4. **Additional Funding**: The project creates extra tasks for community-generated ideas that weren't part of the original grant proposal. These tasks are funded through the platform's community funding feature.

5. **Community Recognition**: As the project implements tasks and reaches planned milestones, it draws attention from the Dodao.dev community. Many tasks receive additional funding, providing developers with extra motivation in the form of tips.

6. **Expanded Impact**: The community-funded tasks are fully funded, bringing in an additional $27,000 in investment, which is used to benefit the project further.

## Sprint Management

In the upcoming version of Dodao.dev, projects will be able to organize their tasks into "Sprints," providing additional benefits:

- The selected developer team can plan tasks into structured sprints
- Sprints are visible on the blockchain as "tasks in a Sprint"
- Sprint progress is trackable and transparent
- The project team, investors, and community can easily monitor:
  - Development progress
  - Fund allocation
  - Sprint status updates

## The Benefits

By using Dodao to multiply their Gitcoin Grant, the project achieves several key benefits:

- **Increased Funding**: Original $55,000 grant multiplied to $82,000 through community contributions
- **Broader Talent Pool**: Access to both trusted developers and community talent
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Clear tracking of fund usage and development progress
