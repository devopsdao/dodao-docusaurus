*The image banner should display a visual representation of how Dodao can help multiply the impact of Gitcoin Grants.*

In this user story, we'll explore how a project can leverage the Dodao platform to maximize the impact of their Gitcoin Grant and involve the broader community in their development process.

## The Challenge

A project has received a $55,000 grant on Gitcoin to build a new decentralized application. They want to make the most of this funding and involve the community in the development process, but they face a few challenges:

- Ensuring transparency and accountability in how the grant funds are used
- Attracting top talent to work on the project
- Engaging the broader community and allowing them to contribute to the project's success

# Multiplying Gitcoin Grant with Dodao

A project has received a $55k grant on Gitcoin.co and wants to make its consumption visible to the community.

They split their work into tasks on Dodao.dev and fund each of them with a part of the grant. For most of the tasks, they select their own developers based on their project NFT tag and wallet ID.

For some tasks, they don't have a developer with a relevant skill profile, so they will accept community performers to take these tasks. They have also created a few tasks for public funding via Dodao.dev because there were extra ideas that didn't fit into the original grant allocation.

Whilst implementing the tasks and reaching planned milestones, the project drew some attention from the Dodao.dev community, and most of the tasks got some extra funding, giving the developers a nice tip to be even more motivated to work on the project. The extra tasks were also fully funded, making $27k in additional investment, which was used for the benefit of the project.

In the next upcoming version of Dodao.dev, it will be possible to create "Sprints" from the tasks. The selected developer team will then plan the tasks into sprints. These sprints will be visible on the blockchain as "tasks" in "a Sprint", and the sprints will be trackable. With every progress made, the sprint status will update:

## The Solution

<<<<<<< HEAD
By using the Dodao platform, the project can overcome these challenges and multiply the impact of their Gitcoin Grant:

1. The project creates a series of Tasks on Dodao, each representing a specific feature or component of their application. They allocate a portion of the grant funds to each Task.
2. For most of the Tasks, the project selects their own trusted developers to work on them. These developers are identified by their Dodao profile NFTs and wallet addresses.
3. For some of the Tasks, the project doesn't have developers with the required skills. They open these Tasks to the broader Dodao community, allowing any qualified Performer to apply and contribute.
4. The project also creates a few additional Tasks for community-generated ideas that weren't part of the original grant proposal. These Tasks are funded by the Dodao community through the platform's crowdfunding feature.
5. As the Tasks are completed and the project reaches its milestones, the Dodao community takes notice and starts to get involved. Many of the Tasks receive additional funding from the community, providing bonuses to the developers and increasing their motivation.
6. The community-funded Tasks are also fully funded, bringing in an additional $27,000 in funding for the project.
7. Throughout the process, the project uses Dodao's Sprint feature to organize the Tasks into focused development cycles. The community can track the progress of each Sprint and see how the grant funds are being used.

By the end of the project, the original $55,000 Gitcoin Grant has been multiplied into $82,000 in total funding, with the additional $27,000 coming from the Dodao community. The project has also benefited from the transparency and accountability provided by the Dodao platform, as well as the expertise and enthusiasm of the broader community.
