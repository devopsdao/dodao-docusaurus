# Cross-chain task marketplace

![Future Work with dodao.dev](./img/banners-new/Future%20Work%20with%20dodao.dev.png)

**Work across any blockchain. Pay with any token.**

Dodao connects customers and performers across all major blockchains with automated verification, built-in escrow, and seamless cross-chain payments.

## Why Dodao?

Traditional freelance platforms force you to choose: either work within their walled garden with limited payment options and high fees, or navigate the complex world of blockchain development alone. Dodao eliminates this false choice by bringing the best of both worlds together.

### üåê Cross-chain
Why should your choice of blockchain limit your opportunities? Whether you prefer Ethereum's security, Polygon's speed, or Moonbeam's innovation, Dodao works everywhere. One account, one reputation, unlimited networks. Your skills aren't confined to a single ecosystem ‚Äì and neither should your work be.

### üí∞ Multi-token  
Forget the days of converting everything to platform-specific tokens or losing money to exchange fees. Pay with whatever you have ‚Äì ETH for security, stablecoins for predictability, or even NFTs for unique arrangements. The choice is yours, not ours.

### ü§ñ Automated
Human intermediaries introduce delays, bias, and errors. Smart contracts execute exactly as programmed, every time. No waiting for manual approvals, no arbitrary policy changes, no "the check is in the mail." When work is completed, payment flows automatically.

## How it works

The complexity of traditional freelance work ‚Äì contracts, escrow services, payment processors, dispute resolution ‚Äì all disappears into three simple steps. What used to take weeks of back-and-forth negotiations now happens automatically.

### 1. Post tasks
Describe what you need and lock your payment in smart contract escrow. No upfront fees, no platform tokens required. Your funds stay secure until work is completed to your satisfaction.

### 2. Get work
Talented performers from around the world compete for your project with detailed proposals. Review their past work, ratings, and approach. Choose based on merit, not marketing.

### 3. Auto-verify
When work is submitted, smart contracts handle verification and payment automatically. No waiting for human approval, no payment delays, no disputes about "processing time." Code executes, payment flows.

## Supported networks

We're building the future of work one blockchain at a time. Our testnet strategy focuses on proving cross-chain compatibility across diverse ecosystems before mainnet launch.

**Current testnet deployment:**
- **Moonbase Alpha** - Testing Ethereum compatibility and Substrate integration
- **Polygon Mumbai** - Validating low-cost, high-speed transaction flows
- **Scroll Sepolia** - Exploring zero-knowledge proof scalability solutions

**Mainnet vision:** Once battle-tested on testnets, we'll deploy across all major networks simultaneously. Ethereum for security, Polygon for speed, Arbitrum for scaling, Moonbeam for Polkadot connectivity, and emerging chains as they mature. Your work opportunities won't be limited by network choice ‚Äì they'll multiply with every blockchain we support.

*Currently perfecting the experience on testnets. When we launch on mainnet, it will be flawless.*

## Our Vision

**Transforming the future of work** through decentralized collaboration.

Dodao isn't just another freelance platform ‚Äì we're pioneering a revolutionary approach to how people work and collaborate in the blockchain space. We envision a world where talented individuals can connect, collaborate, and earn rewards without traditional intermediaries limiting their potential.

Imagine a developer in Lagos collaborating with a designer in S√£o Paulo on a project funded by an entrepreneur in Stockholm ‚Äì all without banks, payment processors, or platform gatekeepers taking their cut. This is the future we're building: a truly global, merit-based economy where your skills and dedication determine your success, not your location, connections, or background.

Our platform creates a decentralized, trustless ecosystem where every transaction is transparent, every rating is permanent, and every opportunity is accessible to anyone with the talent to deliver. We're not just changing how work gets done ‚Äì we're democratizing access to global opportunities.

### Core Principles

**Decentralization**: We eliminate intermediaries that extract value without adding it. When you complete a task on Dodao, smart contracts automatically handle payment, verification, and reputation updates. No human gatekeepers, no arbitrary decisions, no hidden fees. You maintain full control over your work, reputation, and earnings.

**Transparency**: Every transaction, rating, and decision is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of trust and quality. Unlike traditional platforms where algorithms and policies change without notice, Dodao's rules are written in code for everyone to see and verify.

**Meritocracy**: Your skills, dedication, and results determine your success ‚Äì not your location, connections, or ability to game the system. Our reputation system is built on verifiable work completion and peer ratings, creating a true merit-based marketplace.

**Collaboration**: We provide tools that make cross-border, cross-chain collaboration as seamless as working with someone in the same office. Built-in communication, automated escrow, and dispute resolution remove the friction from global teamwork.

**Inclusion**: Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your career, whether you're in Silicon Valley or rural Bangladesh, Dodao provides equal access to opportunities. We're building bridges, not walls.

*Currently on testnet. Perfect time to explore risk-free.*
