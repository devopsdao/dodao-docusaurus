## Partnership Process

Dodao follows a structured and transparent process for identifying, evaluating, and managing partnerships and collaborations, which involves the following steps:

1. Partnership ideation and outreach, where we identify potential partners and opportunities that align with our vision, mission, and values, and reach out to explore initial interest and fit.
2. Partnership assessment and due diligence, where we evaluate the technical, business, and strategic merits and risks of each potential partnership, and conduct thorough due diligence on the partner's reputation, track record, and capabilities.
3. Partnership negotiation and agreement, where we work with the partner to define the scope, terms, and conditions of the collaboration, and formalize the partnership through a written agreement or contract.
4. Partnership implementation and execution, where we work with the partner to plan, coordinate, and execute the activities and deliverables of the collaboration, and monitor and report on the progress and results.
5. Partnership review and optimization, where we periodically assess the performance and impact of the partnership, and identify opportunities for improvement, expansion, or adjustment, based on the feedback and insights from the partners and stakeholders.

Throughout the partnership process, Dodao maintains open and transparent communication with our partners and stakeholders, and seeks to build trust, alignment, and mutual benefit in all our collaborations and engagements.
