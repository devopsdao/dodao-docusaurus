# Auditors

![Secure & Trusted](../img/banners-new/Secure%20&%20Trusted.png)

**Resolve disputes. Earn fees.**

In every marketplace, conflicts arise. But what if those conflicts could be resolved by people who truly understand the work, rather than faceless corporate support teams following rigid scripts? What if fairness wasn't determined by who complains the loudest, but by evidence, expertise, and community consensus?

As a Dodao auditor, you become a guardian of justice in the decentralized work economy. You're not just resolving disputes ‚Äì you're upholding the principles that make fair, transparent work possible. Every decision you make strengthens trust in the platform and ensures that quality work is rewarded while protecting both customers and performers from bad actors.

This isn't just a role; it's a responsibility to the global community of workers who depend on platforms like Dodao to provide fair opportunities and honest dealings.

## Why become an auditor?

Traditional platforms handle disputes with faceless support teams who follow rigid scripts and often favor whoever complains loudest. Dodao puts dispute resolution in the hands of community members who actually understand the work being done. As an auditor, you're not just resolving conflicts ‚Äì you're building the foundation of trust that makes decentralized work possible.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Fair dispute resolution
Every decision you make shapes the platform's reputation for fairness. When customers and performers know that disputes will be handled by knowledgeable peers rather than corporate algorithms, they're more willing to take on challenging projects and pay fair rates.

### üí∞ Earn audit fees
Quality dispute resolution is valuable work that deserves compensation. Unlike traditional platforms where support costs are overhead, Dodao recognizes auditors as essential contributors who earn fees for maintaining platform quality.

### üèÜ Build trust reputation
Your reputation as a fair, knowledgeable auditor becomes a valuable asset. High-rated auditors get access to higher-value disputes, premium fee rates, and recognition as trusted community leaders.

### üõ°Ô∏è Platform governance
Auditors don't just resolve individual disputes ‚Äì they help shape platform policies, quality standards, and community guidelines. Your voice carries weight in decisions that affect the entire ecosystem.
