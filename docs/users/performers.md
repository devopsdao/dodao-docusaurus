![Try as Performer](../img/banners-new/Future%20Work%20with%20dodao.dev.png)

**Find work. Get paid.**

Tired of competing with hundreds of applicants on traditional platforms, only to have clients disappear after you deliver quality work? Frustrated by payment delays, arbitrary account suspensions, and platforms that take 20% of your hard-earned money?

Dodao changes the game. Here, your reputation is permanent and portable, payments are guaranteed by smart contracts, and you keep more of what you earn. Whether you're a developer in Buenos Aires, a designer in Mumbai, or a strategist in Berlin, you have equal access to global opportunities based purely on your skills and track record.

## Why perform on Dodao?

Traditional freelance platforms treat you like a commodity. They take huge cuts of your earnings, can suspend your account without warning, and offer no guarantee you'll actually get paid for your work. Dodao flips this dynamic entirely ‚Äì here, you're in control.

### üåê Cross-chain opportunities
Why limit yourself to one blockchain ecosystem when you could work across all of them? A great Solidity developer shouldn't miss Polygon opportunities just because they prefer Ethereum. Our cross-chain approach multiplies your potential work by connecting all major networks.

### üí∞ Flexible earnings
Stop losing money to forced conversions and platform tokens. Get paid in whatever makes sense for you ‚Äì ETH for long-term holding, USDC for stable income, or even project tokens if you believe in the vision.

### üîí Guaranteed payment
No more wondering if clients will actually pay after you deliver. Smart contract escrow locks their payment before work begins, and releases it automatically when you complete the task. Mathematical certainty beats promises every time.

### üèÜ Build reputation
Your achievements on Dodao are permanent NFTs that prove your capabilities across all blockchains. Unlike traditional platforms where your reputation can disappear overnight, these credentials belong to you forever.

## Getting started

The barrier to entry on Dodao is refreshingly low. No lengthy application processes, no waiting for approval, no credit checks. Just connect your wallet and start building your reputation through quality work.

### 1. Set up your profile
Your profile is your first impression, but unlike traditional platforms, you don't need to reveal personal information. Your wallet address is your identity, and your work speaks for itself.

- Connect Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended) ‚Äì this becomes your permanent identity
- Complete profile with skills and experience ‚Äì focus on what you can deliver
- Add portfolio links and previous work ‚Äì show, don't just tell
- Set preferred payment tokens ‚Äì choose what makes sense for your situation

### 2. Find your first task
Quality over quantity. It's better to apply for fewer tasks that match your skills perfectly than to spam applications everywhere. Customers can tell the difference.

- Browse available tasks across networks ‚Äì opportunities exist on every blockchain
- Filter by skills, payment, and timeline ‚Äì find work that fits your capabilities
- Read requirements carefully ‚Äì understanding the need is half the solution
- Check customer ratings and history ‚Äì work with people who value quality

### 3. Submit winning proposals
Your proposal is your sales pitch. It's not about being the cheapest ‚Äì it's about demonstrating that you understand the problem and can solve it better than anyone else.

- Write compelling, specific proposals that address the customer's exact needs
- Show relevant experience with concrete examples and portfolio links
- Set realistic timelines that account for quality work and revisions
- Price competitively but fairly ‚Äì your time and expertise have value

## Finding the right tasks

**Turn opportunity discovery into a competitive advantage.** The best performers don't just browse tasks randomly ‚Äì they strategically hunt for opportunities that match their skills, pay fairly, and come from customers who value quality work.

### üîç Task discovery

**Your hunting ground for global opportunities.** Every task represents someone's vision waiting to be brought to life. The key is finding the ones where your skills can create the most value.

**Browse by category (find your domain):**
- **Development** - Smart contracts, web apps, mobile (where code becomes reality)
- **Design** - UI/UX, graphics, branding (where creativity meets functionality)
- **Content** - Writing, marketing, documentation (where ideas become communication)
- **Consulting** - Strategy, audits, advisory (where expertise becomes guidance)

**Filter options (narrow your focus):**
- **Payment range** - Set minimum acceptable rates (know your worth)
- **Timeline** - Match your availability (quality takes time)
- **Blockchain** - Choose preferred networks (play to your strengths)
- **Token type** - ETH, stablecoins, or specific tokens (get paid how you want)

*The right task isn't just work ‚Äì it's an opportunity to showcase your expertise and build your reputation.*

### üìä Evaluating opportunities

**Quality recognition starts with quality selection.** The tasks you choose to pursue say as much about your professionalism as the work you deliver. Choose wisely, and customers will notice.

**Good tasks have (green flags that signal quality customers):**
- Clear, detailed requirements (they know what they want)
- Fair payment for scope (they value quality work)
- Realistic timeline (they understand the creative process)
- Responsive customer (they're engaged and available)
- Good customer rating history (they treat performers well)

**Red flags to avoid (warning signs of problematic projects):**

- Unrealistic timelines (pressure that compromises quality)
- Below-market payment (customers who don't value expertise)
- Poor customer communication (frustration waiting to happen)
- History of disputes (pattern of unreasonable expectations)

*Your time is your most valuable asset ‚Äì invest it in opportunities that respect its worth.*

### üìù Proposal structure

**A winning proposal tells a story: their problem, your solution, mutual success.** Each section builds confidence that you're not just capable, but the ideal choice for their specific needs.

**1. Understanding demonstration (prove you get it):**

- Underbid significantly to win (devalues your expertise)
- Promise unrealistic timelines (sets up failure)
- Include irrelevant experience (dilutes your message)
- Use poor grammar or spelling (undermines credibility)

*Your proposal is your first deliverable ‚Äì make it demonstrate the quality they can expect.*

### üí∞ Pricing strategies

**Research market rates:**

- Factor in project complexity
- Include time for revisions

**Pricing models:**
- **Fixed price** - Best for defined scope
- **Hourly rate** - Good for ongoing work

- Provide regular progress updates (eliminate anxiety)
- Be honest about challenges (transparency builds trust)
- Ask questions when unclear (clarity prevents problems)

**Update frequency (stay visible without being annoying):**

**Mathematical certainty replaces trust and hope.** Every step is transparent, verifiable, and automatic. No human can interfere with the process or make arbitrary decisions about your earnings.

**Escrow process (your path to guaranteed payment):**
1. **Task creation** - Customer locks payment in smart contract (commitment you can verify)
2. **Work period** - Funds held securely during development (protection for both parties)

5. **Payment** - Automatic release to your wallet (instant gratification for quality work)

*When code handles payments, human delays and excuses become impossible.*

### ü™ô Supported tokens

- **ETH** - Most common, widely accepted (digital gold for long-term holding)
- **USDC** - Stable value, predictable income (eliminate volatility from your earnings)
- **MATIC** - Low fees on Polygon (efficient for frequent transactions)
- **DEV** - Fast transactions on Moonbeam (cutting-edge network benefits)

**Cross-chain earnings (borderless income):**
- Work on any network (opportunities aren't limited by blockchain choice)
- Get paid in preferred token (your earnings, your choice)
- Automatic cross-chain settlement (seamless behind-the-scenes magic)
- Real-time exchange rates (fair pricing for everyone)

*Your payment preferences should expand your opportunities, not limit them.*
