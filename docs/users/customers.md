**Post tasks. Get results.**

Finding reliable talent for blockchain projects shouldn't be a gamble. Traditional freelance platforms leave you vulnerable to poor quality work, payment disputes, and endless back-and-forth negotiations. Dodao eliminates these frustrations with smart contract automation and blockchain-verified reputation.

Whether you're launching a DeFi protocol, building an NFT marketplace, or creating educational content about Web3, our platform connects you with verified performers who understand your needs and deliver results you can trust.

## Why choose Dodao?

Traditional freelance platforms put all the risk on you. You pay upfront, hope for the best, and often end up disappointed. Dodao flips this model entirely ‚Äì smart contracts ensure you get exactly what you paid for, or your money back.

### üåê Global talent pool
Why limit yourself to performers who happen to use the same blockchain as you? Our cross-chain approach means a Polygon developer can work with an Ethereum customer, and a Moonbeam designer can collaborate with anyone, anywhere.

### üí∞ Flexible payments
Stop losing money to conversion fees and platform-specific tokens. Pay with whatever you already have ‚Äì ETH for simplicity, USDC for stability, or even project tokens for unique arrangements.

### üîí Protected funds
Your payment sits safely in smart contract escrow until work is completed to your satisfaction. No more wondering if freelancers will disappear with your money, no more payment disputes, no more "the check is in the mail."

### ü§ñ Automated verification
Why wait days for human reviewers when smart contracts can verify GitHub PRs instantly? Our oracle integration eliminates the delays and subjectivity of manual approval processes.

## Getting started

The beauty of Dodao is that you can go from idea to posted task in minutes, not days. No lengthy verification processes, no credit checks, no waiting for platform approval. Just connect your wallet and start building.

### 1. Connect wallet
Your wallet is your identity on Dodao. Unlike traditional platforms that require extensive personal information, Web3 lets you maintain privacy while still building trust through blockchain-verified reputation.

- Install MetaMask or use any Web3 wallet you prefer
- Connect to supported testnet (we recommend Moonbase Alpha for beginners)
- Get test tokens from faucets ‚Äì they're free and let you experiment risk-free

### 2. Create your first task
This is where clear communication pays off. The more specific you are about requirements, the better proposals you'll receive. Think of it as writing a contract that enforces itself.

- Click "Create Task" and describe exactly what you need
- Fill in requirements clearly ‚Äì be specific about deliverables and quality standards
- Set fair payment and realistic deadline that attracts quality performers
- Submit and wait for proposals ‚Äì usually within hours on active networks

### 3. Select performer
Don't just pick the cheapest option. Look for performers who understand your requirements, have relevant experience, and communicate professionally. Quality work costs more upfront but saves money in the long run.

- Review incoming proposals carefully ‚Äì look for understanding of your needs
- Check performer ratings and history ‚Äì past performance predicts future results
- Choose best candidate based on skills and approach, not just price
- Work begins automatically once selection is confirmed

## Creating effective tasks

**Transform your vision into guaranteed results.** The difference between getting exactly what you want and settling for disappointment often comes down to how well you communicate your needs. Clear requirements aren't just helpful ‚Äì they're your insurance policy against wasted time and money.

### üìù Task description

**Clarity is power.** When you write a task description, you're not just explaining what you want ‚Äì you're creating a contract that smart contracts will enforce. The more specific you are, the more likely you'll get exactly what you envisioned.

**Be specific and clear:**
- Define exact deliverables (what success looks like)
- Include technical requirements (the non-negotiables)
- Set quality standards (your minimum acceptable outcome)
- Provide examples if helpful (show, don't just tell)

**Good example:**
```
Title: "React component for user dashboard"

Description: 
- Create responsive user dashboard component
- Must use React 18+ and TypeScript
- Include user profile, stats, and settings sections
- Mobile-first design with dark/light theme
- Provide unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- Deliver via GitHub pull request
```

**Avoid vague descriptions that guarantee disappointment:**
```
‚ùå "Need a website" (What kind? For what purpose? What features?)
‚ùå "Fix my code" (What's broken? What should it do instead?)
‚ùå "Make it look better" (Better how? What's your definition of better?)
```

*The five minutes you spend writing clear requirements can save you weeks of revisions and frustration.*

### üí∞ Setting payment

**Choose your token:**
- **ETH** - Most common, widely accepted
- **USDC** - Stable value, predictable costs
- **MATIC** - Low fees on Polygon
- **Custom tokens** - Any ERC-20 supported

**Fair pricing guidelines:**
- Research market rates for similar work
- Consider complexity and timeline
- Factor in performer experience level
- Add buffer for revisions

**Payment examples:**
- **Simple logo design**: 0.1-0.5 ETH
- **Smart contract audit**: 1-5 ETH
- **Mobile app development**: 5-20 ETH
- **Website redesign**: 2-10 ETH

### ‚è∞ Timeline management

**Set realistic deadlines:**
- Allow time for questions and clarification
- Include buffer for revisions
- Consider performer's other commitments
- Factor in complexity of work

**Milestone suggestions:**
- **Week 1**: Initial design/planning
- **Week 2**: Core development
- **Week 3**: Testing and refinement
- **Week 4**: Final delivery and revisions

## Managing your tasks

**Stay in control without micromanaging.** The best customer experience comes from being informed and engaged without becoming a bottleneck. Smart contracts handle the enforcement, so you can focus on providing guidance and feedback.

### üìä Task dashboard

**Your command center for all active work.** Unlike traditional platforms where you're left wondering what's happening, Dodao gives you real-time visibility into every aspect of your projects.

**Monitor progress with confidence:**
- View all active tasks (your entire portfolio at a glance)
- Check performer updates (real-time progress without nagging)
- Track milestone completion (see momentum building toward your goals)
- Review submitted work (quality control before final approval)

**Communication tools that actually work:**
- Built-in messaging system (no more lost emails or scattered conversations)
- File sharing capabilities (seamless collaboration without third-party tools)
- Progress update notifications (stay informed without constant checking)
- Deadline reminders (never miss important milestones)

*Information is power, and power gives you confidence in your decisions.*

### ‚úÖ Work approval

**The moment of truth handled with precision.** This is where smart contracts prove their value ‚Äì no ambiguity, no disputes, just clear criteria and automatic execution.

**Review process that protects everyone:**
1. **Initial submission** - Performer submits work (their moment of pride)
2. **Your review** - Check against requirements (your quality gate)
3. **Request changes** - If revisions needed (clear feedback, not criticism)
4. **Final approval** - Accept completed work (mutual satisfaction)
5. **Payment release** - Automatic via smart contract (instant gratification for quality work)

**Quality checklist for confident decisions:**
- [ ] Meets all stated requirements (the non-negotiables)
- [ ] Delivered in correct format (professional presentation)
- [ ] Quality matches expectations (worth what you're paying)
- [ ] Documentation included (future-proofing your investment)
- [ ] Source files provided (complete ownership of your work)

*Good approval processes protect both parties and build long-term working relationships.*

### üîÑ Handling revisions

**When to request changes:**
- Work doesn't meet requirements
- Quality below expectations
- Missing deliverables
- Technical issues found

**How to request revisions:**
- Be specific about what needs fixing
- Provide clear feedback and examples
- Set reasonable timeline for changes
- Maintain professional communication

## Payment and escrow

**Financial security that works automatically.** Traditional freelance platforms ask you to trust them with your money and hope for the best. Smart contracts eliminate hope from the equation by making security mathematical and automatic.

### üîí How escrow works

**Peace of mind through mathematical certainty.** Every step is transparent, verifiable, and automatic. No human can interfere with the process, change the rules, or make arbitrary decisions about your money.

1. **Task creation** - Your payment locked in smart contract (commitment that can't be broken)
2. **Work period** - Funds held securely during development (protection for both parties)
3. **Completion** - Performer submits final work (their moment of delivery)
4. **Approval** - You review and approve (your quality control gate)
5. **Release** - Payment automatically sent to performer (instant satisfaction for quality work)

*When code handles your money, human error and corruption become impossible.*

### üí≥ Payment options

**True payment freedom.** Why should your choice of token limit your access to talent? Pay with whatever you have, and let the platform handle the complexity of cross-chain transactions.

**Supported tokens (maximum flexibility):**
- **Native tokens** - ETH, MATIC, DEV (what you already hold)
- **Stablecoins** - USDC, USDT via Axelar (predictable value, no volatility surprises)
- **ERC-20 tokens** - Any standard token (including your project's own currency)
- **NFTs** - ERC-721 and ERC-1155 (creative compensation for unique arrangements)

**Cross-chain payments (borderless transactions):**
- Pay on one network, work delivered on another (true blockchain interoperability)
- Automatic token bridging via protocols (seamless behind-the-scenes magic)
- Real-time exchange rates (fair pricing for everyone)
- Minimal fees and fast settlement (efficiency that saves you money)

*Your payment options should expand your opportunities, not limit them.*

## Building reputation

**Your reputation is your competitive advantage.** In a global marketplace where talent has choices, the best performers gravitate toward customers who are fair, clear, and professional. Your reputation becomes your ability to attract top talent.

### ‚≠ê Rating system

**Fairness builds the ecosystem.** When you rate performers accurately, you help other customers make better decisions while building trust with the talent community. Your reputation for fair ratings becomes a magnet for quality work.

**Rate performers with integrity:**
- **5 stars** - Exceptional work, exceeded expectations (rare and deserved recognition)
- **4 stars** - Good work, met requirements (solid professional performance)
- **3 stars** - Acceptable work, minor issues (room for improvement but delivered)
- **2 stars** - Below expectations, significant issues (clear problems that affected outcome)
- **1 star** - Poor work, major problems (fundamental failure to deliver)

**Your customer rating matters:**
- Based on performer feedback (they rate you too)
- Affects ability to attract top talent (reputation precedes you)
- Improved by clear communication (clarity builds trust)
- Enhanced by fair payment and ratings (integrity attracts quality)

*Fair ratings create a virtuous cycle that benefits everyone in the ecosystem.*

### üèÜ Customer benefits

**Excellence attracts excellence.** When you build a reputation for being a great customer to work with, the best performers seek you out instead of you having to chase them.

**High-rated customers enjoy:**
- Priority responses from performers (your messages get answered first)
- Access to premium talent (the best performers want to work with you)
