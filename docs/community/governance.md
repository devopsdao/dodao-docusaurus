# Governance

![United by dodao.dev](../img/banners-new/United%20by%20dodao.dev.png)

**Community-driven decisions.**

What if the platforms you use every day were actually controlled by the people who use them? What if instead of faceless corporations making decisions that affect your livelihood, you had a real voice in shaping the rules, features, and future direction?

Dodao's governance isn't just about voting on proposals ‚Äì it's about fundamentally reimagining how platforms should work. Every token holder becomes a stakeholder with real power. Every decision is transparent and recorded on-chain. Every voice matters, whether you're a developer in Delhi, a designer in Detroit, or a customer in Copenhagen.

This is democracy for the digital age: where your participation directly influences the platform you depend on, where transparency isn't a marketing buzzword but a technical guarantee, and where the community truly controls its own destiny.

Your voice. Your platform. Your future.

## Governance overview

### üó≥Ô∏è Decentralized decision making

**Power to the people who actually use the platform.** Traditional platforms make decisions in boardrooms behind closed doors. We make decisions in public forums where every voice can be heard and every vote can be verified.

**Core principles (the foundation of true democracy):**
- Community-driven development (users decide what gets built)
- Transparent decision processes (every discussion is public)
- Token-based voting rights (your stake gives you a voice)
- Merit-based influence (contribution earns respect)

**Governance scope (what you actually control):**
- Platform feature priorities (what gets built first)
- Token economics parameters (how value flows through the system)
- Community program funding (where resources go to grow the ecosystem)
- Partnership approvals (who we work with and why)
- Protocol upgrades (how the platform evolves)

*This isn't just voting ‚Äì it's taking ownership of the platform you depend on.*

### üéØ Governance goals

**Building a platform that serves its community, not corporate shareholders.** Every decision we make together moves us closer to a future where platforms are owned and controlled by the people who create value on them.

**Platform evolution (guided by user needs, not profit margins):**
- Prioritize user-requested features (build what people actually want)
- Balance stakeholder interests (fair outcomes for everyone)
- Ensure sustainable growth (long-term thinking over short-term gains)
- Maintain security standards (protect what we're building together)

**Community empowerment (democracy in action):**
- Give users control over platform (your platform, your rules)
- Reward active participation (engagement creates value and earns influence)
- Build long-term alignment (shared success through shared ownership)
- Foster collaborative development (better solutions through collective intelligence)

*Together, we're not just using a platform ‚Äì we're building the future of work.*

## Governance structure

### üë• Participants

**Every voice matters, but contribution earns influence.** This isn't just one-person-one-vote democracy ‚Äì it's a system that recognizes both stake and merit, ensuring that those who contribute most to the platform have the strongest voice in its future.

**Token holders (the foundation of our democracy)**
- Basic voting rights on all proposals (your stake, your voice)
- Voting power proportional to token holdings (bigger stake, bigger voice)
- Can delegate votes to other participants (trust others to represent your interests)
- Earn rewards for participation (democracy pays when you engage)

**Governor NFT holders (earned leadership through contribution)**
- Enhanced voting power (2x multiplier) (merit amplifies influence)
- Proposal creation rights (shape the conversation)
- Access to governance discussions (insider access to decision-making)
- Priority in community programs (contribution opens doors)

**Core contributors (the builders and guardians)**
- Technical proposal creation (expertise guides implementation)
- Implementation oversight (ensure quality delivery)
- Security review participation (protect what we're building)
- Emergency response authority (rapid response when needed)

**Community council (elected representatives of the people)**
- Elected representatives (5 members) (democracy in action)
- 6-month terms with re-election (accountability through regular elections)
- Proposal moderation and guidance (shepherding good ideas forward)
- Conflict resolution authority (fair arbitration when needed)

*From token holder to core contributor ‚Äì there's a path for everyone to grow their influence through contribution.*

### üèõÔ∏è Governance tokens

- Platform utility tokens used for voting
- Earned through platform participation
- Tradeable on secondary markets
- Required for proposal submission

**Governor NFTs:**
- Limited supply governance tokens
- Enhanced voting power and privileges
- Earned through significant contributions
- Non-transferable to maintain merit-based system

**Delegation system:**
- Token holders can delegate voting power
- Delegates earn rewards for participation
- Delegation can be revoked at any time
- Transparent delegation tracking
