# Ambassador Program

![Support Us](../img/become-an-ambassador-iphone.png)

The mission of Dodao is to become a major platform for software development in the blockchain community â€“ not only because of its innovative technology, but also because of its close-knit community. Dodao will be owned and governed by its stakeholders (developers, shareholders, board members, and DAO Treasury). We have been inspired by the low gas fees and speed of the Moonbeam network and its compatibility with ERC20. We strongly believe that traditional recruitment processes in an epoch of post-covid shift from offices to home-office work need to be changed and decentralized. Our app aims to help the crypto community manage recruitment in a preferred crypto way, residing in the crypto space.
