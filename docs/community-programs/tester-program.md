# About Dodao

![Try as Performer](../img/test-dodao-iphone.png)

The mission of Dodao is to become a major dApp platform for software development in the blockchain community â€“ not only because of its innovative technology but also because of its community full of experts and vision. Dodao will be owned and governed by developers. We have been inspired by the low gas fees and speed of the Moonbeam network and its compatibility with ERC20. We strongly believe that traditional recruitment processes in an epoch of post-covid shift from offices to home-office work need to be changed and decentralized.

The fact that we have won a prize at the first hackathon we have joined is a good sign that we are on the right path. Find more information here.

## Why Dodao?

There is no other project comparable to ours currently in the market. We are launching as a fully decentralized mobile app available on iOS, Android, and also on Microsoft, macOS, and Linux.
