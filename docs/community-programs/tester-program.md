About Dodao


![try as performer](../img/test-dodao-iphone.png)

The mission of Dodao is becoming a major dApp platform for software development in the blockchain community – not only because of its innovative technology, but also because of its community full of experts and vision. Dodao will be owned and governed by developers. We have been inspired by the low gas fees and speed of Moonbeam network and its compatibility with ERC20, and strongly believe that traditional recruitment processes in an epoch of post-covid shift from offices to home-office work needs to be changed and decentralized.

That we have won a prize on the first hackathon weh ave joined is a good sign we are on the right way. Find more information here.
Why Dodao?

There is no other project comparable to ours currently in the market. We are launching as a fully decentralized mobile app available on iOS, Android and also on Microsoft, MacOS and Linux.
