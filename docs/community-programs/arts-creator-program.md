# Arts Creator Program

![Become Arts Creator](../img/become-arts-creator.png)

**Where creativity meets opportunity in the decentralized economy.**

*"Art has always been about breaking boundaries. Now it's time to break the boundaries of how artists get paid, recognized, and empowered."*

Welcome to a revolution that's been centuries in the making. For too long, artists have been at the mercy of gatekeepers, platforms that take massive cuts, and systems that undervalue creative work. The Arts Creator Program isn't just another opportunity ‚Äì it's your gateway to true creative sovereignty in the digital age.

Here, your art doesn't just decorate the platform; it defines it. Your creativity doesn't just add value; it earns governance rights. Your work doesn't just get displayed; it gets rewarded with ownership in the ecosystem you're helping to build.

This is where art meets blockchain, creativity meets community, and passion meets profit ‚Äì all on your terms.

## The creative revolution begins

### üé® Beyond traditional art platforms

**The old way (what we're leaving behind):**
- Platforms take 30-50% of your earnings
- Your art can be removed or hidden by algorithm changes
- No say in platform policies that affect your livelihood
- Limited payment options and delayed payouts
- Competing in oversaturated marketplaces
- Building audience on borrowed land

**The Dodao way (your creative future):**
- Platform fees of just 2.5% with governance token rewards
- Your art and reputation stored on blockchain, truly owned by you
- Vote on platform direction and creator program policies
- Instant crypto payments in your preferred tokens
- Curated opportunities matching your unique style
- Building permanent, portable creative identity

*"We're not just changing how artists get paid ‚Äì we're changing who controls the creative economy."*

### üåü What makes this different

**True ownership of your creative identity:**
Your portfolio, reputation, and creative history live on the blockchain, not in some company's database. When you build your reputation here, you own it forever ‚Äì no platform can take it away, hide it, or hold it hostage.

**Governance participation:**
As an Arts Creator Program member, you don't just use the platform ‚Äì you help shape it. Vote on creator policies, suggest new features, and participate in decisions about how the creative economy should work.

**Cross-chain opportunities:**
Your art can be commissioned, sold, and appreciated across multiple blockchain networks. A collector on Ethereum can commission work that gets delivered on Polygon, with payments flowing seamlessly between chains.

**Community over competition:**
Instead of fighting for visibility in an oversaturated marketplace, you're part of a curated community where quality and creativity are recognized and rewarded.

## Program overview
