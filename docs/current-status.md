# Current Development Status

This document provides an overview of the technical details and current development status of the Dodao.dev platform.

![Smart Contract Architecture](./img/dodao-smart-contract-arch-mermaid.png)

## Definitions

We use the following terms to describe development status:
- **Implementation**: Feature or component is developed to a certain state
- **Started Implementation**: Development has begun but is not yet completed
- **Refactoring**: Previous implementation has been significantly changed or improved
- If a feature is not mentioned, development has not yet started

For mainnet launch readiness:
- **[ready]**: Generally ready, only minor changes may be required
- **[mvp]**: Provides basic functionality, needs more development and testing
- **[dev]**: Under development, has some functionality but not ready for testing
- **[mock]**: Mocked-up contract, development has not yet started

  - Reads Tasks data from Task contracts
  - Manages Task contracts blacklist
  - Enables batch Task loading

- **LibTasks.sol** [ready] and **LibTasksAudit.sol** [ready]
  - Provide underlying functions for Task facets

- **LibChat.sol** [ready]
  - Provides in-Task chat functions

- **LibTokens.sol** [ready]
  - Provides core ERC-1155 functions

- **TokenDataFacet.sol** [mvp] and **LibTokenData.sol** [mvp]
  - Handle project-specific token functions

### Connected Contracts Facets

- **InterchainFacet.sol** [mock]
  - Implements protocol-specific functions for:
    - Axelar
    - Hyperlane
    - LayerZero
    - Wormhole

- **TasksInterchainFacet.sol** [dev]
  - Enables cross-chain Task contract interactions

- Protocol-specific facets [dev]:
  - AxelarFacet.sol

  - LayerzeroFacet.sol
  - WormholeFacet.sol

### Witnet Oracle Facets

- **WitnetFacet.sol** [dev]
  - Connects with Witnet oracles
