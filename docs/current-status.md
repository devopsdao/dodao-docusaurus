# Current Status

*Last Updated: December 24, 2024*

## Platform Overview

**Dodao** is a cross-chain task marketplace built on advanced blockchain infrastructure. Currently in **testnet phase** with comprehensive smart contract implementation and multi-chain support.

## üöÄ Technical Implementation

Building a truly decentralized marketplace requires solving problems that traditional platforms never had to face. How do you create trust without a central authority? How do you handle payments across different blockchains? How do you upgrade systems without breaking existing functionality? We've spent months solving these challenges with battle-tested solutions.

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**Smart Contract Architecture**
The foundation of everything we do. While other platforms rely on centralized servers that can go down, change rules, or lock you out, our smart contracts provide mathematical guarantees that work the same way every time.

- **Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535)**: Upgradeable contract system that grows with the ecosystem without breaking existing functionality
- **Cross-Chain Infrastructure**: 4 protocol integrations ensuring your transactions always find the optimal path for speed, cost, and security

- **Task Lifecycle Management**: Complete automation from task creation to payment release, eliminating human bottlenecks
- **Role-Based System**: NFT-based permissions that prove your capabilities and unlock platform features

**Advanced Features**
These aren't just nice-to-have features ‚Äì they're the innovations that make decentralized work actually work better than traditional platforms.

- **Automated Verification**: Witnet oracle integration that verifies GitHub PRs automatically, eliminating waiting for human reviewers
