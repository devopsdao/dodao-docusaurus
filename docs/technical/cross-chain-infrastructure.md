# Cross-Chain Infrastructure

![Cross-Chain Infrastructure](../img/dodao-design-update.png)

**Connecting the multiverse of blockchain networks.**

*"The future isn't about choosing the right blockchain ‚Äì it's about building applications that transcend blockchain boundaries entirely."*

Welcome to the technical foundation that makes Dodao truly universal. Our cross-chain infrastructure isn't just about moving tokens between networks; it's about creating a seamless, unified experience where users can work, transact, and build reputation across any blockchain without friction or compromise.

This is where cutting-edge interoperability protocols meet real-world usability, where complex multi-chain operations become as simple as a single click, and where the promise of a truly connected blockchain ecosystem becomes reality.

## Cross-chain vision

### üåê Beyond single-chain limitations

**The multi-chain reality:**
The blockchain ecosystem has evolved into a diverse landscape of specialized networks, each optimized for different use cases. Rather than seeing this as fragmentation, we embrace it as specialization ‚Äì and build infrastructure to connect it all.

**Our approach:**
- **Network agnostic**: Users shouldn't need to know or care which blockchain they're using
- **Seamless experience**: Cross-chain operations feel like native single-chain interactions
- **Optimal routing**: Automatically choose the best path for cost, speed, and security
- **Universal compatibility**: Support for any blockchain that meets our security standards

**The Dodao difference:**
While other platforms force users to choose a single blockchain, we let them use them all. Your work history on Ethereum is accessible on Polygon. Your reputation on Moonbeam transfers to Arbitrum. Your payments flow seamlessly between any supported networks.

### üîó Interoperability principles

**Security first:**
Cross-chain operations introduce additional complexity and potential attack vectors. Our infrastructure prioritizes security above all else, using battle-tested protocols and multiple validation layers.

**User experience focus:**
Complex multi-chain operations are abstracted away. Users see simple, familiar interfaces while sophisticated routing and optimization happen behind the scenes.

**Economic efficiency:**
Intelligent routing finds the most cost-effective path for each operation, considering gas fees, bridge costs, and exchange rates across all supported networks.

**Reliability and redundancy:**
Multiple bridge protocols and fallback mechanisms ensure operations complete successfully even if individual components experience issues.

// Cross-chain payment examples
interface CrossChainPayment {
  sourceChain: string;
  destinationChain: string;
  token: string;
  amount: bigint;
  recipient: string;
  bridge: BridgeProtocol;
}

// Ethereum to Polygon USDC payment
const ethToPolygonPayment: CrossChainPayment = {
  sourceChain: "ethereum",
  destinationChain: "polygon",
  token: "USDC",
  amount: parseUnits("1000", 6),
  recipient: "0x...",
  bridge: BridgeProtocol.AXELAR
};

// Moonbeam to Arbitrum ETH payment
const moonbeamToArbitrumPayment: CrossChainPayment = {
  sourceChain: "moonbeam",
  destinationChain: "arbitrum",
  token: "ETH",
  amount: parseEther("0.5"),
  recipient: "0x...",
  bridge: BridgeProtocol.LAYERZERO
};
```

        // Validate destination chain
        require(chainIds[destinationChain] != 0, "Unsupported chain");
        
        // Generate operation ID
        operationId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
            msg.sender,
            destinationChain,
            payload,
            block.timestamp
        ));
        
        // Store operation

        require(
            validatorConfirmations[operationId] >= REQUIRED_CONFIRMATIONS,
            "Insufficient validator consensus"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    modifier notExpired(bytes32 operationId) {
        require(
            operations[operationId].timestamp + OPERATION_TIMEOUT > block.timestamp,
            "Operation expired"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    function confirmOperation(bytes32 operationId) external {
        require(trustedValidators[msg.sender], "Not a trusted validator");
        validatorConfirmations[operationId]++;
        
        if (validatorConfirmations[operationId] >= REQUIRED_CONFIRMATIONS) {

  confidence: number;
}

class OptimizedCostCalculator implements CostCalculator {
  async calculateTotalCost(
    operation: CrossChainOperation,
    route: BridgeRoute
  ): Promise<OperationCost> {
    // Get real-time gas prices
    const sourceGasPrice = await this.getGasPrice(operation.sourceChain);
    const destGasPrice = await this.getGasPrice(operation.destinationChain);
    
    // Calculate bridge-specific fees
