# Architecture Overview

![Dodao Smart Contract Architecture](../img/dodao-smart-contract-arch-mermaid.png)

**Building the infrastructure for the future of work.**

*"Great architecture isn't just about solving today's problems ‚Äì it's about creating a foundation that can evolve, scale, and adapt to challenges we haven't even imagined yet."*

Welcome to the technical heart of Dodao, where cutting-edge blockchain technology meets real-world scalability requirements. This isn't just another smart contract system ‚Äì it's a carefully architected ecosystem designed to handle millions of work relationships across multiple blockchain networks while maintaining security, efficiency, and user experience excellence.

Every design decision here reflects our commitment to building infrastructure that will power the global economy of the future, where work transcends borders, platforms, and traditional limitations.

## Architectural philosophy

### üèóÔ∏è Design principles

**Modularity and upgradability:**
Built on the Diamond pattern (EIP-2535), our architecture allows for seamless upgrades and feature additions without disrupting existing functionality or requiring user migrations.

**Cross-chain by design:**
Native multi-chain support isn't an afterthought ‚Äì it's fundamental to our architecture. Every component is designed to work seamlessly across different blockchain networks.

**Security first:**
Multiple layers of security, from smart contract audits to cross-chain validation, ensure that user funds and data remain protected at all times.

**Scalability without compromise:**
Designed to handle millions of transactions while maintaining decentralization and security. Performance optimizations at every layer.

**User experience focus:**
Complex blockchain operations are abstracted away, providing users with familiar, intuitive interfaces while maintaining full decentralization benefits.

### üåê Multi-chain vision

**Network agnostic design:**
Our architecture treats blockchain networks as interchangeable infrastructure, allowing users to work across any supported chain without friction.

**Unified user experience:**
Whether you're on Ethereum, Polygon, Moonbeam, or any other supported network, the user experience remains consistent and seamless.

**Cross-chain value flow:**
Payments, reputation, and work history flow seamlessly between chains, creating a truly unified global work ecosystem.

The Diamond pattern (EIP-2535) allows us to create upgradeable smart contracts that can grow and evolve without the limitations of traditional proxy patterns.

**Core benefits:**
- **Unlimited contract size**: No 24KB contract size limit
- **Modular upgrades**: Add, replace, or remove functions without affecting others
- **Gas efficiency**: Only pay for functions you actually use
- **Transparent upgrades**: All changes are recorded on-chain
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing integrations continue to work

**Diamond structure:**
```solidity
// Diamond Proxy Contract
contract DodaoDiamond {
    // Core diamond functionality
    // Facet management
    // Access control
    // Emergency procedures
}

// Individual Facets
contract TaskCreateFacet {
    // Task creation and management
}

contract TaskDataFacet {
    // Task data retrieval and updates
}

contract AccountFacet {
    // User account management
}

contract TokenFacet {
    // Multi-token payment handling
}
```

**Cross-chain message flow:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant S as Source Chain
    participant B as Bridge Protocol
    participant D as Destination Chain
    participant R as Recipient
    
    U->>S: Initiate cross-chain transaction
    S->>B: Send message with payload
    B->>B: Validate and process
    B->>D: Relay message to destination
    D->>R: Execute on destination chain
    R->>U: Confirm completion
```

## Pure on-chain architecture

### üîó Web3 integration layer

**Custom web3dart library:**
Our Flutter applications use a custom-developed web3dart library that provides:

**Flutter application architecture:**
```dart
// Core service structure
class DodaoService {
  final Web3Client _client;
  final String _contractAddress;
  final int _chainId;
  
  // Direct contract interactions
  Future<String> createTask(...) async {
    final contract = _getContract();
    final transaction = Transaction.callContract(...);
    return await _client.sendTransaction(...);
  }
  
  // Real-time event listening
  void listenToEvents() {
    _client.events(...).listen((event) {
      // Handle blockchain events
    });
  }
}
```

### üóÑÔ∏è Pure on-chain storage strategy
